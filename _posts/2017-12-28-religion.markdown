In this post, I'll explain my understanding about religion, or more specificly, Christianity. 

God provides love to break this zero-sum game that we human beings are playing. 


# Making the world a better place

One of the most important shift of ideology brought by Christianity would be "bring light to the world around you" - to make the world within your reach a better place. 

Some may argue that we cannot tell what's "better". Some may argue that let everyone behave according to their desire is the best way. 

Not to mention that people and market need to be regulated in reality. 

What works is not everyone fighting for their selfish desire. What works is to let everyone work for the things that they desire for. It would naturally makes him work harder and more efficiently. Don't use this to justify selfish desires.
