(I received education from both Chinese and western institutes, but at different stages of my life. The differences I listed here are from my personal experience and subject to my biases. 
For example, some of the differences could totally be because that I received basic education in Chinese institutes but post-secondary education in a western institute.)

Education from personal experience:

Whether the things you learned is perfect. How to understand, reason, and solve problems when there are limited information?

When you reach a higher level, or when you are solving any unique problem in the real world, no one is going to tell you how, no one is able to, if someone is able to, he/she won't because it's too valuable, or he/she won't have time and patience to teach you. 

There's no "one single correct way" to education. But there might be a better one.
