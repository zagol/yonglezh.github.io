First, we as human beings can be defensive in one way or another, in one situation or another. Accept this and feel safe about it. 

"Don't be defensive." is the path to truth and growth. 

How to make the other people in a conversation/relationship(work,friend,romantic) feel safe and not be defensive? 

> For people to feel safe in a conversation, two criteria need to be met.

> These are:

> Mutual purpose: When others believe that your goals are aligned, that you understand and care about their perspective, and that you are sincere in communicating this
> Mutual respect: When others believe that you respect them. That means genuine respect, as it is very easy to pick up on a lack of respect through body language.
> Without a mutual purpose, you may not even be able to get the conversation started. Without mutual respect, the conversation is likely to turn into a battle for lost dignity.
