需要纠正的是：来这个世界上，是来做事的，不是来探路的；是来做事的，不是来找最好的方法的。

找到感兴趣的事情，勤奋的去做，不要管别人的看法。



直到读博士，才逐渐的从导师那里学到了如何问问题和解决问题。


每个人都有界限，从那以后就是神的领域，可以理解为sign。比如，一段关系的终结有时候无可挽回，可以认为是神的sign，但是依然可以分析原因，下次做得更好。再想想……

why do I want to be a good person? 
why do I want to believe? 
What's the proof to you? 

I want to make everyone in my life grateful for my existence. Why? 
I'm crafty in both games and real life. Should I fix this? How do I fix this? 


还有在PHD期间做research学到的提出问题、陈述观点、分析问题的方式。Don't stop asking questions! Don't ever stop. I know it's tiring. But don't ever stop asking questions. That's the only way leading to first principle reasoning. That's the only way to real insights and real innovation. 

Do we really have free will? What if free will is just an illusion? 



So what does Sin look like in our lives? Basically, Sin is that persistent impulse to care more about ourselves than about others and to decide that only we are able to decide what is right or wrong for us. (What's said here feels GOOD! But not sure if I agree here. What if selfishness is a must-have for human beings to build a better society? How do we live if we don't decide what's right or wrong for us? Is he saying to avoid sin means to care about others as much as we care about ourselves, and ask God what's right or wrong? If we give up our pursuit for what's right/wrong, does it mean that we give up our gifts/freewill from God?)
At an unconscious level it involves treating other humans as though they are somehow less than human. (How to define human here? Even if we treat each other badly, it doesn't mean that we are treating each other less than human. Perhaps we are suppose to compete and treat each other like shit...? I know this is too extreme... Just an example.)
At the same time, it involves thinking of ourselves as more than human, as though gods in our own right. (What if God is the ultimate result of evolution? Then it's possible that we are suppose to compete with each other and try to become God, right?)
The irony is that behaving that way actually makes you less human. (Need definition of human again. I'm not sure what can make us "less human", since we all sin, although in different ways, but we all sin.)
"Looking out for number one," that's what I'm talking about. 
(Great examples from here on! Should pay attention to in my everyday life!)
Selling out a colleague when things go wrong, or pushing past people at the subway station to get ahead of them. Looking for sex or cheap thrills without wanting to commit to the needs and feelings of that other person whose body you find attractive. Looking down on other people because they don't hold the same sophisticated beliefs that you do - maybe they eat meat, or they eat only vegetables, or they vote for Donald Trump. Cursing at the driver of a 'Not in Service' bus or yelling at your kid just for failing to meet your expectations. Using way more than your share of resources when others out there have less than they need. Hoping that something bad happens to someone else because you are jealous of them, or want what they have. Speding your time and energy or morally dubious entertainment because it's easier to veg than to work constructively on excercising, or praying, or chatting with people about things that really matter. All of these actions are subhuman (still not sure about 'subhuman', but I do very agree that they are great examples of how we can waste our lives on meaningless things and hurting others); each one makes you more beast-like. 

What do I really want? 
Why am I crafty? Why am I not able to face what I really want? 
Is it because my desires are dirty? I'm ashamed of my desires? 
Is it because I cannot bear the responsibilities? To desire something, even if it's good desire, means I need to take the responsibility to do something. 
Is it because I feel unsafe? Why do I feel unsafe?

Now or never!

I put too much emphasize on the past. 

The other day, when I was playing a board game with some friends, I was said to be crafty. 

I didn't know what the word meant, and looked it up. 

'Crafty' means to be clever at achieving one's aims by indirect or deceitful methods.

I think it's OK to be crafty in board games. But it makes me wonder if I'm crafty in real life too. 


It feels bad to be crafty in real life. What should a good person be? 
Honest 

What do I really want? 
Why am I crafty? Why am I not able to face what I really want? 
Is it because my desires are dirty? I'm ashamed of my desires? 
Is it because I cannot bear the responsibilities? To desire something, even if it's good desire, means I need to take the responsibility to do something. 
Is it because I feel unsafe? Why do I feel unsafe?
Why am I ashamed of what I want? 

Why do I tell half truth? Why do I reserve the truth? 
If it's not possible to tell the real truth, what's the point of telling all the things that you think? 


It makes me wonder - 1) Is it true that I'm a crafty player? 2) Am I crafty in real life too? 3) Why am I crafty? 

Keep this in mind: It's not about me! 

I wanted to be a person like Ben. I want to be able to serve whole heartedly. I tried to manipulate people. It failed. 

A daily practice (might be good?):
Before I do something, or say something, ask myself what's the reason for doing/saying this? 
Asking the reason for doing something, helps me to clarify my goal, and stop wasting my time on things don't matter to my goals. 
Asking the reason for saying something, helps me to be honest with myself (? why it helps?), helps me to decide whether I should say something or not, helps me to clarify my idea and express things clearly. 

How do we believe that other people are real? How do we believe that the world is not a matrix? We took a leap of faith. We can never be sure of it. 
We can never be sure whether there's such a God. But now I'm going to take another leap of faith. - Is it the same thing? Are these 2 steps the same? Perhaps not. 

"Now a question of the form: If I do this, what will happen? is strictly scientific.  As a matter of fact, science can be defined as a method for, and a body of information obtained by, trying to answer only questions which can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen?  The technique of it, fundamentally, is: Try it and see.  Then you put together a large amount of information from such experiences.  All scientists will agree that a question – any question, philosophical or other – which cannot be put into the form that can be tested by experiment (or, in simple terms, that cannot be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen?) is not a scientific question; it is outside the realm of science."

"The heritages of Western civilization
 
Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages.  One is the scientific spirit of adventure – the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it – the humility of the intellect.  The other great heritage is Christian ethics – the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual – the humility of the spirit.
 
These two heritages are logically, thoroughly consistent.  But logic is not all; one needs one's heart to follow an idea.  If people are going back to religion, what are they going back to?  Is the modern church a place to give comfort to a man who doubts God‑more, one who disbelieves in God?  Is the modern church a place to give comfort and encouragement to the value of such doubts?  So far, have we not drawn strength and comfort to maintain the one or the other of these consistent heritages in a way which attacks the values of the other?  Is this unavoidable?  How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid?  Is this not the central problem of our time?"

I agree that people's lives are changed. But I'm not sure about the reason. Is it because of God? Or is it because of the concept of God? I agree that prayers work. But I'm not sure about the reason. Is it because of God? Or is it because of the strength from being honest and reminding oneself what's more important? 

What's more important is to work, work, keep working, find your own way. You might do it because you want to be your own God, or you might want to fulfill the gift you received from God, it doesn't matter. Whatever works matters. 

Some of my basic ideas are changing: 
  - I need to rely on myself and God, instead of other people. 
  - Be tough! But not for myself! For God, for other people, for my brothers and sisters! 
  - I love human beings - my brothers and sisters, as how I'm loved by God and Christians.

If we doubt really hard, we cannot be 100% sure about anything - we might live in a Matrix! 
If I believe that the computer in front of me is real, people around me are real, why couldn't I take another step to believe God is real? 
Why? What's the difference between the 2 steps? 
Does that mean I can take another step to believe in anything...? 

Do I approach Christian because I want people to think I'm a good person?

So many ideas and behaviors have already become my subconsciousness. How do I know how to live as God's people? 

Was I glad to be called a thinker? 

渺小的事情，集中精力在渺小的事情上的人，永远不能保护重要的事物。

State before I had Chenying: get through the day. 
State after I had Chenying: fighting everyday for a future that I love with Chenying!
State after breaking-up: want to be dead.  
I should try to get back to the state when I was with Chenying. But with a different goal. 

我不能跳回过去的怪圈：找一个人依赖，然后崩溃。
我只能依赖自己和上帝。

Perhaps 尽量少解释行为的原因？除非必须的时候。因为解释行为的原因，就有机会误导对方，选择性的挑选解释。
只有做工作的时候尽量去解释。
Let the behavior speak for itself. 

God, please show me that you have all I need. Please. 

God, I need you to be the center of my life. Please. 

Use logical questions as your guide while learning. Or you'll get lost. 

When I tell a story, it tends to become amazing, why? Is it that I tend to make drama out of things? Am I still consider myself to be special or somehow important? 


If Christian is the only way for me, is this the right reason for me to believe? 

My dad noticed that he didn't want to influence my choice on certain things. The more important thing is why he didn't notice that I don't have the capability to make my own choice without being influenced?!!

I was a cynic, until I met God's love. 

I couldn't separate myself from God. 

Keep praying. Invite God to be here. 

Read bible. Read God's word. 

What's the proof I need to believe? They say Jesus's resurection. But to me it's possible that it's not true. 
Why do I believe those ancient emperiors but not God?
1) Ancient emperiors don't matter that much. Believing won't change my life that much. 
2) Ancient emperiors are not that unique. Similar things happened all the time. To believe such a unique thing as God requires higher-standard proof. 

If I believe Jesus's resurection, what about other religions? What's the difference between the other religions' proof and Christiananity's proof? 

People believe what they want to believe. People pick what they want to believe. 

If there will always be a gap between evidence and belief, why not believe other Gods? 

If no evidence is the proof, what about logic itself? What about the feeling of oneself (self consciousness)?. What about causal relationship (logic)?. 

只做确定心底不求回报的事情？

Why can't I ask for help? If I don't have ego now, I should be able to ask people to help me, right? I should be able to admit that I'm not able to solve this and I need people's help. As far as it helps to get it to work, as far as it helps to solve the proble, why shouldn't I ask for help? 

You should try to be the kind of person everyone turns to for help. At the same time manage yourself smartly. 

What's the relationship between religion and hope? It feels that religion is a kind of method to provide hope in this cruel and unpredictable world. 
It means religion comes from human's desire to predict the future, is it? 

I don't need that much love from people. I don't need that much attention from people. Because God loves me. 

It's not that you say something, then you don't have to be responsible! E.g., it's not that after I told Cynthia that I'm not able to offer unconditional love, then I can just do those things to hurt her! 

Compared to knowing something that might not be true, I prefer not knowing. 

There are similarities across different religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism). Is it possible that it reveals that religion is just the common wisdom of how a person should live? 

If we look at history, peace is not obtained with God. Peace is infact obtained with the most extreme violence - nuclear weapons. 

人与人之间的差距并没有大到足以互相看不起和伤害。
但人与人之间的差距大到需要天天努力才能不落后。
