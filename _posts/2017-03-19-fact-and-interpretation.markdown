One important aspect of human beings' lives is to understand the world and to change the world. To achieve this goal, I believe that scientific method is the right way. 

There are other alternatives to achieve the same goal. Some may say [tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition), intuition, or [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion). Others may argue that certain religion contains scientific method within it. I'm not capable of giving a clear definition of Religion or one single religion. So in this post I'll only explain **my understanding of scientific method**, instead of reasoning about why to choose it over other alternatives. 

There are other very important aspects of our lives, such as how to live a happy life and how to live in harmony. Personally I believe religion plays a more important role in these aspects. I'll explain my understanding about religion in another post.  

<!-- and why I choose to believe in it. I won't try to explain why I don't choose religion in this aspect of life, because according to my belief in scientific method, there's no scientific way to say religion is wrong at this point in time. -->

# What is Scientific Method?

As Bertrand Russell said, scientific method is the procedure to identify facts and the truth that the facts bear out. It usually includes the following steps: 

1. Making observations of phenomenon (facts). A phenomenon is an event that's observable in any manner - something that's observed to occur or exist.  
2. Formulating hypothesis (potential truth in certain scope) to explain the phenomenon (What is it? Why does it exist? Or why did it happen?). 
3. Developing **testable** predictions from the hypothesis. 
4. Performing reasonable (can-be-reasoned-about) experiments repeatedly by different indepedent experimenters. 

Clearly defined terms and scope/context. 

> Like any good scientist, you may question the range of situations (outside of science) in which the scientific method may be applied. From what has been stated above, we determine that the scientific method works best in situations where one can isolate the phenomenon of interest, by eliminating or accounting for extraneous factors, and where one can repeatedly test the system under study after making limited, controlled changes in it.

> There are, of course, circumstances when one cannot isolate the phenomena or when one cannot repeat the measurement over and over again. In such cases the results may depend in part on the history of a situation. This often occurs in social interactions between people. For example, when a lawyer makes arguments in front of a jury in court, she or he cannot try other approaches by repeating the trial over and over again in front of the same jury. In a new trial, the jury composition will be different. Even the same jury hearing a new set of arguments cannot be expected to forget what they heard before.

# Epistemology - the fundation of scientific method

What is a fact? What is truth? Can we know truth? What can we know? 

# Different level of abstractions

It's all about contexts and abstractions. An abstraction is a complete description of a thing. It describes all the constraints and behaviors this thing reveals interacting with outside world. The outside worls is its context. It is composed of other abstractions. 

There are levels of abstractions. At certain level of abstractions, reductionism-style reasoning works. At some other level of abstractions, system-theory style reasoning works. At some other level of abstractions, causal relationship might not work - quantum physics. 


# Conclusion

To me, scientific method stops at I don't know, religion stops at God's design, tradition stops at this is what you should do according to our ancestors. 

To choose scientific method is to say "yes human beings are limited, and let's operate within our limitations. I don't know if there's God yet. If there's really God and God designed us, it's God's responsibility to help us to see him."


Even though in real life we are limited by time, resource, and our capability, and often have to make compromises, scientific method is still the right way. Optimization. 

There's no one single ultimate goal of human beings' lives, but a bunch of aspects. 


What cannot be described with scientific method, cannot be discussed. 

What is scientific method? 


Why is it the only way?

How to explain the trend that miricles disappearred as modern technology appeared? 

<!-- Reason -->

Epistemology is a topic that has been discussed by philosophers throughout human history. I want to clarify the positions with which I personally feel comfortable. 

<!--The reasoning can be not 100% complete in the sense that some word or logic might not be explained, because a serious effort to achieve 100% completeness will lead to a comprehensive research even on a limited topic. However, hopefully the words written down make sense to some people, and reasoning written down is persuasive. -->

The motivation behind this post is that I wish Christianity to be real, and I personally think it would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but at this moment I don't think there's enough evidence based on my personal experience and my understanding of the world. Writing down my ideas on Epistemology helps me to clarify the basis of my reasoning. 

### Fact & Interpretation (There's no fact but interpretation.)

A _predicate_ is a statement about a subject. A _predicate_ is either true or false. For example, the sky is blue, Leo has a high GPA, or the sun rises from the west. 

Our natural language can be ambiguous sometimes and needs clarification. In the first example, time and location need to be specified, because the sky is not always blue in every place on earth. In the 2nd example, "high" needs to be defined for the predicate to be evaluated. 

Moreover, paradoxes exist because there's limitation both in human cognition (our ability to comprehend the real world) and natural language (its ability to describe the real world). A simple example would be "this sentence is false." 

Paradoxes are excluded from this post mainly because discussing them is beyond my capability. 

Paradoxes are excluded from this post because:

1. Paradox is not common.
2. Throughout history, human beings have been trying to resolve paradoxes whenever they appear, and every resolution of an important paradox leads to deeper understanding of the world. 
3. Discussing paradoxes is beyond my capability. 
Nevertheless, I'll try to avoid paradox in any of the logic that I use. 

A _fact_ is a _predicate_ which is true. An _interpretation_ is a _predicate_ which **some people think** is true. 

For example, "someone is smart because he has a top-1% GPA" is obviously an interpretation because the logic link here is not solid in the sense that smartness is not clearly defined and there's no proved causal relationship between smartness and top-1% GPA. 

However, even "Leo has a top-1% GPA" is an interpretation if we take a scrutiny. How do I know Leo has a top-1% GPA? If I've heard it from another person, how do I know that person's word is trustworthy? Even if that person's word is somehow trustworthy, how do I know my memory and his memory are trustworthy? If me saw Leo's rank from a paper record or website, how do I know the paper record or website was not hijacked? Fundamentally, it has been repeatedly proven human beings' senses and memory are not 100% reliable. 2 different people can see things differently. For example, the sky is clean because it's blue. This is an obvious one. However, even the sky is blue is also an interpretation because some people might see it as green. 

So is it that there's no objective fact but only interpretation? Or there is objective fact but human beings won't be able to see it as it is? 
I cannot prove it's not true. It's possible there's not objective fact. It's possible we all live in a matrix and all of our interpretations are wrong. 
However, this belief has no practical usage in terms of teaching us how we should live our lives. 

Are there facts if it's precisely described? (Problems become harder and harder. You realized that you really need to communicate with people. You need to think clearly and express clearly. You need to be able to collaborate with people.)

The basis of our interpretation includes our senses (which can be wrong or different from person to person), our memory (which can be wrong or forgot), our logic (which has unresolved paradoxes).  

Then the question becomes which interpretation is the best one. This is where different belief systems come into play. It's hard to define 'best' without omnipotent power and omniscient knowledge, and this is why people make their own choices based on their own experience. 
 
So far from human beings' history, definitely an interpretation that can incorporate science. This is not just evidenced through history, but also from our everyday life. (What does evidence mean here?)

Really, we do really looks more like animals, just think of the times when there's not enough resource and we have to compete with each other for life. 

What about something happened? Matrix. However we cannot live with this assumption. We need to assume that induction and deduction works. We need to assume that causal relationship is real and we have the ability to discover it.

Someone did something - this fact gets blurred as time flies. People will start doubting. 
No matter how magic something is, as time flies, people will start doubting. 

I accept how limited I am. I accept that I cannot see concrete evidence. If God designed me to be this limited, he might not want to save me. 

What can be treated as a fact? People who believes in it doesn't have benefit from it? (This is really hard to rule out.) Solid proof? Can be verified by anyone? What does it mean by verify? History cannot be repeated so cannot be verified 100%. What can be verified? Predication. 

Some say human beings can never reach _fact_, i.e., there's no _fact_ but only _interpretation_. For example, physic theories are human beings' interpretations of the physical world, and they have been always changing because we can never reach what the world really is (complete skeptism).  

Then let's treat something most people agree on as fact? This is dangerous. Most people (suppose everyone is honest) would agree on? Most people (suppose everyone is honest) ONCE illustrated the reasoning procedure, would agree on? What if people are stupid? Assumption: only a small portion of people are stupid, another portion of people are blinded by biases or emotions, suppose everyone is not blinded by biases nor emotions, most people's intellect is enough to understand logic reasoning. What is logic reasoning? Induction and reduction. 

I spent some time on epistemology in colledge, and came to a few vague conclusions, or some positions that I'm personally comfortable with.  

- Self-consciousness is real. (It might be an illusion, or a side effect caused by ***the ability to remember the past and predict the future***, and ***the ability to differentiate and classify objects and events***, which are developed for animals to better survive the world. Either way it exists.)
- The law of causation is how human beings perceive/understand the world at our level. (So even though (David Hume) it's possible that the law of causation doesn't exist in reality, or human beings can only sense happen-before relationship but not real law of causation, human beings can only use law of causation to perceive the world.)
- Human senses are not completely reliable. 
- Human memories are not completely reliable. 
- Human rationality is limited (Gödel's incompleteness theorems). 
- Limited rationality is often further blinded by different kinds of biases. 

- Despite all, human beings have to rely on senses and memories and the law of causation to understand the world. 
- Skeptism is perfect? But it's useless. 

- Uncertainty is certain. Skeptism is means but not the truth. 

In this post, I'm only going to talk about what are facts, but not any reasoning procedure based on facts. (Is this possible?)

What is fact? What can we know? Is it true that there's no facts but only interpretations? 

I explored a bit about 1) what's true (which predicates are true), 2) what's real (something exists - true), 3) what do we know is true for sure, 4) what can we know is true for sure (we might not be able to know everything), 5) how do we know something is true for sure. 


What's the definition of fact? A statement that can be verified as true. (What about in quantum physics the state of something is different with different observers?)
What is perceived as fact by people? 

What's truth? What's the relationship between fact and truth? 

What's interpretation? Human beings' senses and memories are not reliable. If the only truth that no one can deny is the existence of him/herself, does it mean that everything else is left open to interpretation? 

How to prove something? 

Talk and behave in certain ways, not because it makes you feel good, but because it makes sense to your goal. 

Speak, behave, not because of 

How to avoid being carried away by our blind spot? Acknowledge that we can be wrong and we can make mistakes. 

We see this trend - as human techonology and society advances, what we used to consider as random or from god now seems to be caused by good reasons. (But we also developed new understanding about God.)

How do I know that this is not the biggest lie that we tell ourselves, just to rationalize the kind of world we want? 

If I realized that I can never prove whether god exist or not, what would I choose? 

There are facts, truth, that have been verified repeatitively, what's the difference between these facts and religion? 

Is skeptism real? Seems it's never going to be able to be invalidated if a person holds a complete skeptism position - no evidence is enough. 

Complete skeptism cannot be defeated, but totally not practical. What does it mean by "practical"? Have influence on the empirical world. 

I think in the end, my position is that I don't have the capability to assert any statement in this field, but only a few positions that I'm personally comfortable with. 

Why is 1+1=2 true? Is this a fact? 
It's all because of definition. We defined 1 as ONE, we defined the operation of putting ONE and ONE together as plus, we defined the end result as TWO. 

Complete skeptism is completely useless. 

Always live with a clear rational purpose, but not an unclear emotional drive. 

Believe in other people's existence. Believe in physic world's existence. 

Does God work in a practical way? I.e., everything we experience is done by him in a way that can be explained with physical reasoning. 

At the same time, those that we cannot understand, might be able to understand in the future. 

There's something similar between religion and skeptism - they all need that one thing to break the assumption. Complete skeptism leads to the conclusion that we'll never be able to know the reality. It leaves room for God. 

Love - at least from experience. 
Does every generation need to hurt and fight, and experience Christianity, in order to understand love? 

Meaning of life is to make things happen but not own things, is to offer love but not to be popular, is to solve problems but not to show off or be better than another person. 

At this moment, I see more evidence that this is something that human being desire, rather than this is something that's true. Every time I look into my own heart, my desire that it's real is so strong. Cannot move myself all the time. Or I'm so short-sighted that I cannot see the evidence. 

Interestingly, hating the same thing can quickly draw people close, even quicker than loving the same thing.

What's worth dying for? This is a bigger question. Success? Other people's evaluation? The advance of human species? Love? Have I been living for what's worth dying for? 

Learnt from personal experience - fact & love. Not just personal experience, but experience from history. What is love here? 

Too many things in Bible give me the impression that it's made up so that it's easier to explain God. For example, "Don't test God" - why? we test our parents all the time! When we were young we trust parents so much because all the things we learnt were simple things that our parents have the correct answer, and as we grow up we meet things that our parents cannot handle so that we start relying on ourselves. 

Big things - make human feel small. That's what's in common for a lot of religion experience. 

There are issues that I cannot overcome. 
1. Why other religions are false?
2. Why some people are going to hell? Why not just disappear? This seems more like something made up forcing people to believe to me. 
3. Why is it that it's harder for "smart" people to accept God? Why is it that it's easier to accept God during weakness? This seems more like something made up for people to believe easier. 

The desire to have a perfect father. 

Is it true that human beings will always need to learn from hurting each other? 每个人都要经历互相伤害的螺旋。

There's no guarantee that human beings will prosperous. Is it true that human beings have been improving all the time throughout history? 

Once we invented reliable method to pass knowledge on to future generations, human beings' development as a species or as a society is unstoppable, unless our knowledge reaches a point when one best human being cannot learn enough to make new progress during his/her life time. However we'll keep improving our life span and ability to learn and make new knowledge. 

If there's some better being, I could imagine that us to them is like dogs or other animals to us. From our point of view, dogs are easy to forget things, hard to learn, etc. Difference is that dogs can see us! 

If you say God is the single exception of this world, I cannot prove that it's not! It's the same when it comes to complete skeptism, I can never prove that this is the truth and there's no other exception, I can never prove that the sun always rises from the east, because it's always possible that an exception happens and we need to change our theory to explain it! 

People need narrative to find purpose. Either they live in others' narratives, like sports fans, religions, or they create their own narratives that they believe in. Hope, purpose, meaning, all reside in narratives. 

Although there are too many false Gods and too many tricks, but I cannot rule out the possibility that there's God and this is the real God. It's like complete Skeptism, I cannot rule out the possibility that the sun won't rise tomorrow. If it happens, I need to adjust my understanding. 

Almost question answered by Christianity could have an alternative answer. And all the alternative answers are still consistent. Are they? No. 
1. What caused big bang? 
Causal relationship builds upon time. without time it doesn't matter. It doesn't make sense to reason about what caused big bang because casual relationship doesn't exist. 

I believe in the love taught in bible, but only because of personal experience. I saw the changing power of that kind of love, I saw the actual benefit of that power (including less conflicts among people, more contribution, less anxeity, people can see further but not just what's in front of them), I choose to believe that's better than complete merciless competition which not only leads to personal pain but also might lead to shortsighted destroy of the entire species. 
The love here is not romantic love. It's a deep sympathy for another human, which leads to care/help for no return within a certain limit. 

There are too many Gods, and too many false Gods. If I'm going to take a leap of faith, which one? 

Either raise our limits, give us more power to know God; or give us more obvious evidence that this must be God, and Jesus is the only God. 
There are too many things in religion that makes me feel this is for the convenience of explanation, instead of this is real. 

It makes no practical sense to go complete skeptism. But bible is passed down by people who believes. There can be too much intention to make it up intentionally or illusionally. 

Be careful when you want to believe in something that makes you feel good about yourself. It is especially hard to tell whether it's true or not. 

When it takes a top person's life time to just grasp the knowledge of a field before he/she can create any knowledge, it's time human society will stop growing. We need to keep strengthen our ability and make sure it won't happen. 

Nothing is trustworthy unless it can be repeated. Almost nothing in history can be repeated in an accurate way. Even a controlled experiment can be influenced by unknown factors that were not taken into account. To what extent should we trust? Where should we draw the line? 

Don't value hero when they have one --> the biggest pity and shame. 

Most people are easily brainwashed. 

It helped me to choose what's important in my life. 

Do you choose to believe in great men who genuinely worked their life to contribute to greater good? Or do you believe in everything done by human is selfish, and "great men" just fooled themselves? This is a choice. Do you choose to live in a community / society who choose to respect these great men, or consider them fools? 

The thing with agnostic is this - it doesn't encourage immoral behaviors (like casual sex), it just doesn't enforce any restrictions on it when there's no proof that there's consequence otherwise. Whether you want to do it or not is totally personal choice! This is consistent with the core concept of agnosticism - there are things that can be proved, so that we believe, for the rest, we leave them free for people to choose because we don't know, and we don't judge until there's a real proof about its consequence. 

What's missing in a lot of the books in bible, is that what's the benefit of those prophacies? 
Everything seems to have another explanation that's easier to relate to according to our everyday life, including illusion, madness, collective ignorance, self-interest of prophacies, etc. And history has been proven that most of the prophacies were really doing those because of madness or self-interest.  

Don't hold on to love. Give up ownership, in order to love and receive love freely. 

Human beings remember and predict things, so that we have a lot of regrets, and for people who can look at things objectively, they usually blame themselves for not being able to do better. This burden is heavy. We need forgiveness. It's better from a higher authority. 

I don't believe. But I already know what type of person I want to be. I don't need to wait for faith. Don't believe doesn't mean that I have to go back to my old self. Don't use no faith as an excuse. 
Why am I waiting if I already know the kind of person I want to be? Do I
really know? Why do I feel I need to prove it's reasonable?

Suggestions for loving: 
1. Listen compassionately. 
2. Be present. 
3. Do something practical. 
4. Love freely. No ownership. Allow other people to love you as much as they can. No expectation. 
Give people freedom to be who they are. (This is a stretch - what about your children? You want to regulate them too, right?)
5. Forgive. Even betray. 
6. Pray. 

What active ways of chaste loving can be part of my life? What can I do for the people in the world around me? 

================================================================

If we cannot prove something exist, is there a difference if we think they don't exist? 

Consciousness comes from human's ability to distinguish objects, which is required for prediction of future. 

Are human beings doomed to fight against each other, hurt each other, kill each other? Love for no return is the only way out, and cannot be performed without faith in God. 

To me the foundamental questions is that whether logic is created by God or simply our boundary. 

Where do science and religion meet? 

The ultimate goal of life is to survive. The ultimate way to survive is to have a great capability to predict the future with low cost (energy efficient). 

vicious cycle 

One thing to notice is that: it's easy to love others when things are easy, however when you are facing tough choices, can you still choose the loving way? 

Don't worry about the outcomes and consequences, even though as human beings we worry inevitably. Only focus on 2 things: making contributions & spreading love. Making contribution means exploring problems (understainding, studying, building solutions) in a logical way. Spreading love means offering love for no return.  

However, viewing Christianity as a choice but not **The Truth** makes me neither a chritian nor a scientist. Choosing to believe something that has no solid proof yet is against the scientific methodology, unless I divide my world view into an area that can be explored by scientific method and an area (life) to which scientific method cannot be applied (and why it cannot be applied to?). 

It's a turning point. My life is not about keep earning something anymore. It became about contributions - what can I bring about to the world around me? At least the focus is shifted, and this is the new direction that I'll keep focusing on. 

It's too hard to really prove something. Moreover, things get more and more blur with time flies by. Human beings just needs constant reminding, if you really want them to believe in something. 

We believe in a certain historical event happened, could be because that we are brainwashed. The only way to prove something really happened, depends on eye witnesses and their motives. 

As a person reaches towards the limitation of human beings' capability (reasoning, science, or engineering), he/she becomes able to see more and more unresolved problems. 

There's no randomness. Randomness is only a tool for us to explain things at a higher level without diving into details. (There can be randomness in physics - quantum physics.) Everything is connected by causal relationship. Or it's because it's the way we see the world. 

"The human brain has evolved to be particularly sensitive to patterns and causality. It's so effective at this, in fact, that people often see a pattern or purpose in things that are actually random. This is why it's easy to identify objects or faces in the clouds, for example, or why white noise can be interpreted to resemble human speech. This same sensitivity can make random or unrelated events seem like the presence of God, especially if the person experiencing them has a predisposition toward wanting those beliefs to be true." - from [this link](http://www.atheistrepublic.com/blog/arminnavabi/why-there-no-god-quick-responses-10-common-theist-arguments).

It’s all about abstraction. Before you reach the level of abstraction you want to stop at, you use reductionism, when you reached there, you use system thinking. [Reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)
[Systems Thinking](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)

Systems thinking: 1) the relationships among the parts in the target system, 2) the behavior of the target system as a whole and the factors that are influencing it. 

The purpose of adult life is to make contribution, is to serve the people around you, the community around you, the part of world you can reach. To be able to behave according to this purpose needs practice. 

Our understanding of the world is based on our capability to observe the world at our current level. We need to extend this ability, either through tools, or through evolution of ourselves. This is the only way. We don't know if there's a bound of our ability, yet. This is the only way we can go. What does it mean by extending this capability? Telescope is a simple example. Math tools that can be used to predict physic phenomenon. 

Cloud Atlas: every crime and kindness bears the consequence. 

Generalization is useful, but can be dangerous. Generalizing any scientific theory can be dangerous. Because most scientific theory has strictly defined context. Analogy is based on abstraction. If you see the relationship between some things is similar to the relationship between some other things, note that here how you identify "things" is based on the level of abstraction. Personally I don't have that deep understanding of evolutionism, I don't know it's context and conclusions that clearly. 

One interesting idea would be: what if human beings are immigrants from some other planets, and built earth by hands (this explains how complex animals suddenly appeared). Our memory is lost somehow, and we come up with a theory (God) to explain ourselves?

You can't have so many question so that you cannot make any move! You have to take steps! 

Causal relationship only works on certain abstraction level. In quantum physics it's different. 

For example, quantum mechanics could be the basic for free mind. However the reasoning here is too vague. It's too far away and can only be treat as a statement or belief. 

**Our minds are not consistent! How can we say that something is always consistent? It might be, but we cannot know it's always consistent! We can only say that something works in certain context, and it can be verified! And this is science.**

There are places where I keep hitting on and cannot overcome. For example, 1) God's mysterious plan, 2) everyone has their own way to God, 3) God by definition is beyond our understanding, beyond the logic we use, out of space and time. These ideas simply cannot be disputed in anyway. 

Complex patterns can evolve from simple designs in a way the designer couldn't reason about. But this is just a possibility. 

We as human beings are so limited that we'll never know. At best we can only be agnostic. Thus God came down to point to us. Why didn't he do more? Why? 

If we look at history, peace is not obtained with God. Peace is infact obtained with the most extreme violence - nuclear weapon. 

# Some questions

A list of questions christians' ask to prove God's existence, and I think there could be other answers. 

1. What's the origin of Universe? 

The answer God is not better than Universe itself to me. 

2. Is it just not going to bring the society to a good balance without belief in general love? 

3. What is science? What is scientific method? 

4. Evolutionary benifit - is this enough to explain everything? Is it the correct way to explain everything? Or is it just a tool that can be used to explain everything like God? At least you can find some single evidence with evolutionary benifit approach. 

5. Personal relationship - cannot be refuted because it's completely subjective. But does it mean it's a proof? No. We mentioned there's not objective fact, then what's the 'objective' here? 

6. Possibly we are fooled by ourselves. We are too ignorant to see that we are beings like ants and our understanding of the world is too shallow. But why does a powerful God care about us? 

7. Proving something didn't happen, something doesn't exist is always harder than proving something happened and something exist, is it? Is this why the burden of proof is on the shoulder of the people claiming something exist? 

8. It's only self-explanary because anything that can't be explained can be pushed to God. Also, the context of each sentence is different, and there are too many possibilities a person can use to interprete the context (book context, historical context). 

9. The reason we tries to find God is because we have this reasoning capability. It might be just a way human beings understand the world, but not how the world really works. 

10. Possible world -> essense -> posteriori necessity -> counterfactual -> causal relationship. What is this? 

11. People all believe in what they want to believe. This can't be used to dispute any belief, can it? 

# Benefits

1. You need to do something to bring light to this world. You need to force yourself to do the right thing, to do the good thing. How to define contribution here? 

2. People's thoughts and behaviors are fundemantally influenced by their positions (social status). Christianity has the ability to change people's perception of their positions, and further change their behaviors. 

3. We have to be able to trust other people, in order for a community to grow. As a society grows bigger and bigger, one won'e be able to reason about things other people say or do, he has to trust somehow. How to build a trustworthy society is the fundamental problem. It's more complicated than this. '

4. Help people to see a bigger picture. 

5. Avoid situations like this: when someone is trying to do something good, other people will jump out and say that person has flaws so he's not justified to say anything. We are all flawed. But we need to be able to recognize heroic behaviors. 

# Cons

1. Christiananity shouldn't be a tool that a person can use to achieve self-righteousness, feel better about oneself, to feel more self-righteousness than other people, pity others. Share other people's pain doesn't mean pity, but it's easily mistaken. 

2. There's too much ridiculous analogy in Christianity, which jepodize how people should be trained to reason clearly. (Though it's better than not trained to be reason.)

# Structure

What can we know about the world? What can we do about the world? What should we do about the world? 

1. There's no fact, only interpretation. 
2. Scientific method is the way to discover an interpretation that has the ability to predict the future. Scientific method is not an interpretation. 

    What's scientific method. Why is it important? Where religion doesn't fit. Do science and religion meet somewhere?
    It is about open source, being able to be replicated by anybody. 
    
3. Similarity between religion and complete agnostic. 
4. Those cannot be perceived, there's no point discussing it. But keep extending our ability to perceive the world! This is the only meaningful thing that we can do. We don't know whether we are going to be able to get something in the future! What does this say about belief? 
5. Causal relationship works on certain abstraction, and it only works **sometimes**. 
6. What to do? Use the tools at hand (at your level of abstraction) to make contribution. What' is contribution here? Extend human beings' ability to perceive and change the world. 
7. It's enough to influence the world even just sometimes.

What's my current position? Why (what's my understanding about science and relgion)? 

## Base 

Fact: something that can be repeatedly verified by different entities. "There's no fact, only interpretation." along with Matrix analogy -> true but there's no practical meaning. Fact about the past: eye witnesses (better: who has little self-interest or any other type of bias towards the claim). A unique / fundamental claim bears a larger burden of proof. Any history starts blurring after 50 years. 

Different people see different color -> with some inconsistency that we notice, and more understanding of it, we know that what color we perceive is more relevant to the cells in our eyes. When there's some inconsistency, we develop our understanding that can be verified considering the inconsistency. It's like saying - when we don't see conflict/inconsistency, we treat it as fact, however it's actually always interpretation of some truth we don't know. 

We see things at our level. How do we see things at other levels? There are too many possibilities, how do we know Christian God is the one? 

## More about scientific method


## About Christianity

1. Choice between religion and agnostic. 

2. Choice between all religions. 


Why it seems to me that a lot of things in Bible is trying to make it easier to believe? "Don't test God."

I believe in scientific method, but I also believe that Christianity is the thing that I need for me to stick to what I believe. 

I called and you answered.
