As long as you keep solving problems that no one has solved before, you'll end up somewhere really good. This problem that no one has solved before, can be similar problem but in a different context. 

You need to be able to distinguish finding reasons and finding excuses. Reasons are something that you have the ability to work upon and change. Excuses are usually something you may or may not be able to change. I.e., don't blame on something not within your control. You often find yourself having defensive feelings when you're finding excuses. 

I think it's normal that people behave differently in different social context. People should try to offer more in a safer environment. People should try harder to protect themselves in a bad environment. But where's the boundary? 

There are too many skills (communication, writing, being a good person, etc.). No one's going to master them all. Understanding a skill is nothing. Practicing it until you own it is the real thing. We only have limited time. Make your choices. 

Another thing that should be learned in our education is that although life is a series of tasks, but they are not isolated. The experience that you learned from some job might be able to be (might should be) applied in later ones.
