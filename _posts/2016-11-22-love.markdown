"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. "

Love is not blind. There is parenting in it. 

Love is not about feeling happy, neither is it about feeling good about oneself. 

Love is a verb, an action. 

Keep on loving even if you feel the person doesn't deserve it. It is God but not us who decides whether a person deserves to be loved. 

God is always there loving us, when we are going through ups and downs. When you feel that you are the happiest and most lucky guy in the world, it's not just because of her, but because of God. When you feel that there's no hope at all and life is just a living hell, God is still there loving you. 

Don't give up. Pain is the biggest opportunity for growth.
